      <p id="about-text">My name is Jeff Smith, I've been a chef now for over 10 years now. I worked for corporate restaurants for most of my career. Three of those years traveling the country opening restaurants for Dave & Buster's and Miller ale House. I have two beautiful children. Taking my kids to school everyday for the past two years really open my eyes to a issue we have in most of Philadelphia communities. The lack of quality, fresh, affordable meals. We are mostly eating and feeding our children Chinese food and food from corner stores. Mostly have next to no nutritional value. Some people can not get to a grocery store to buy fruits and vegetables. I want to change that by opening a take out restaurant in West Philadelphia. Where you can come and a great meal for a affordable price. 

      For the people that take their family out to eat, sometimes go 10 to 15 miles out of their community just to get a quality meal. Most go straight to places like T G I Friday's, Longhorn steakhouse, Chili's, Buffalo wild wings. Why can't we have the food these kind of restaurants serve in our own communities?  You will be able to at my restaurant!

          Thank you for all the support and love !
